## Overview

Mo'o (also spelled moʻo) are supernatural beings in Hawaiian mythology that manifest as gigantic lizards or dragons, most commonly associated with freshwater streams, pools, and underground caves. **Mo'o are powerful 'aumākua (ancestral guardian spirits)** who protect water sources and can take various forms, from small lizards to massive reptilian creatures hundreds of feet long.

In Hawaiian cosmology, mo'o represent the sacred connection between land ('āina) and water (wai), serving as guardians of precious freshwater resources. Some mo'o are benevolent protectors, while others are dangerous and must be respected or appeased. Many Hawaiian families claim mo'o as their 'aumākua, maintaining spiritual relationships that continue to the present day.

**CULTURAL SENSITIVITY**: Mo'o are part of **living Native Hawaiian spiritual tradition**. These are not merely "folklore" but active religious/cultural beliefs for many Hawaiian families and communities.
